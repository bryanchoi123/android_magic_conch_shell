# The Magic Conch Shell
App to simulate the experience of using the Magic Conch Shell from the TV show Spongebob Squarepants

## Description
### Mobile
Similar to a Magic 8-Ball Toy, the user asks a question and presses the image of the Magic Conch Shell to get a response.
The response will be given in the form of text as well as audio corresponding to the response.

There is an option to view all the responses that are in the application, but not much else at the moment.

### Watch
Similar to the mobile application, the user asks a question and presses the image of the Magic Conch Shell on the watch.
The response will be given in the form of text only for the Android Wear application.

## Disclaimer
I am not affiliated with Nickelodeon or Spongebob Squarepants in any way.
I do not own the audio files that are default in the application, nor do I own the image of the Magic Conch Shell.
